# topScorer(data) [10 Points]
# Write the function topScorer(data) that takes a multi-line 
# string encoding scores as csv data for some kind of 
# competition with players receiving scores, so each 
# line has comma-separated values. The first value on 
# each line is the name of the player (which you can 
# assume has no integers in it), and each value after 
# that is an individual score (which you can assume is a 
# non-negative integer). You should add all the scores 
# for that player, and then return the player with the 
# highest total score. If there is a tie, return all the 
# tied players in a comma-separated string with the names 
# in the same order they appeared in the original data. 
# If nobody wins (there is no data), return None (not the 
# string "None"). So, for example:

def topScorer(data):
    if data == "":
        return None
    # Your code goes here...
    lis = data.splitlines()
    # print(lis)
    s = ""
    prev =0
    temp = ""
    for i in range(len(lis)):
        sum = 0
        l = lis[i].split(",")
        # print(l)
        
        
        for j in range(1, len(l)):
            sum+= int(l[j])
            # temp = l[0]
        # print(sum, temp)
        if sum > prev:
            prev = sum
            temp = l[0]
            
            
        elif sum == prev:
            
            if s == "":
                s+=temp + ","+ l[0]
            else:
                if temp not in s:
                    s+="," + temp 
                s+= ","+ l[0]
    # print(temp, sum)       
    # print(s) 
    if len(s)>1:
        return s   
    return temp
